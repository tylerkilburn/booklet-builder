    "I pray for leaders in my church and churches around the world. Give them Your wisdom and discernment as they lead. I pray that their hearts would be directed first to You, that they would recognize where their true help and strength come from. I ask that you would guard their coming and going, that You would be their refuge and their peace. I pray that you would surround each one with wise counsel, that they would be humble, kind and patient. I pray that their faith in You would be unwavering.",
